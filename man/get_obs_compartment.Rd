For ADVAN1-4/11-12 this is easy, for other ADVANs we have to make some
assumptions based on whether scaling parameters have already been defined
for the model. Logic is as follows:
\itemize{
\item if S1 is defined and not S2, assume it's 1.
\item if S2 is defined and not S1, assume it's 2
\item if both are defined, assume it's 2 but show a warning
\item if none are defined, assume it's 2 but show a warning
}
}
